# Django-Blog
This is fully working personal blog post built using django and bootstrap 5
Since it is a personal there is no a form where you can write your new blog post rather I use the Django admin area to add new post.
If downloaded the code make sure to ceate a new super user so you can add new posts.
python manage.py createsuperuser this command will allow you to create super user account.
Oh yeah I forget to add the link to the javascript script this is why the hamburger menu is not working to
fix that simply the add the script tag alongside the javascript bundles files
